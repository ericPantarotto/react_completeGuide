# React - The Complete Guide 2024 (incl. Next.js, Redux)

## Getting Started

### What is React.js?

**React.js is a JavaScript library for building user intefaces**.

As you navigate around React websites, you'll see that all these transitions are super smooth, pretty much instant, and you never have this effect where you seem to load a new page.

To some extent, it therefore feels like a mobile app, because in mobile apps, getting instant feedback and having smooth transitions is pretty much the standard.

#### Using "just JavaScript" typically isn't a great option

- writing complex JavaScript code quickly becomes cumbersome
- complex JavaCcript code quickly become error-prone
- complex JavaCcript code often is hard to maintain or edit

### ReactJS vs "Vanilla JavaScript"

With React, in the example provided, in that app.js file, we just got that HTML code with  dynamic elements blended into the HTML code. It defines different states of the different HTML elements, such as an active CSS class added to a button.

- React , you define the target UI states - not the steps to go there (Declarative)
- with JavaScript, you define the steps, not the goal (Imperative)

### Creating React Projects

**<span style='color: #a3842c'>Link:** [Codesandbox_react](react.new)

---

if you prefer to use **VSCode** editor, you need to have installed *NodeJS*, as *ReactJS* uses tool such as *Vite*

**<span style='color: #a3842c'>Link:** [https://vitejs.dev/guide/](https://vitejs.dev/guide/)

`npm create vite@latest first_react_app -- --template react`

- `cd` into project
- `npm i`
- `npm run dev`

### Why do we need a special project setup?

Because when writing React code,

you'll use this special HTML in JavaScript feature, this syntax is called **JSX**.

It unfortunately doesn't work in the browser, So therefore the code you write actually must be transformed to code that does run in the browser.

![image info](./1_sc1.png)

That's the reason why you need to create React projects with extra tools like *Vite*.

because it's those tools which do transform your code to code that can be executed efficiently in the browser.

That's why you can't just create a basic HTML and script file but why you instead do need those extra tools.

## JavaScript Refresher

### Adding JavaScript to a Page & How React Projects differ

#### JavaScript can be executed in many environments

![image info](./2_sc1.png)

#### Adding JavaScript Code to a Website

- between `<script>` tags
- via `<script>` **Import**

`<script src="assets/scripts/app.js" defer type="module"></script>` unlocks 1 very important syntax: *ES6 Import* syntax.

**<span style='color: #495fcb'> Note:** when you're working on a React project, you will almost never add these script tags to your HTML file on your own, because React projects almost always use a build process which as part of that build process, injects these script tags into the HTML code for you.

### React Projects use a Build Process

`react-scripts` package provides a bunch of tools that take your code and transform it behind the scenes before it's then injected into the browser. Or to be precise, before it's then injected with help of a script tag into the HTML file.

if you inspect a web page, you can find script elements, generated and injected into this HTML file automatically behind the scenes by this built process that's running in the background.

#### Your code is transformed before it's handed off to the browser / Why React projects typically require a build process that transforms your code

**<span style='color: #495fcb'> Note:** *Vite*, *create-react-app, ... , give you such a build process (no custom setup or tweaking neede)

- raw unprocessed React Code won't execute in the browser, mostly because *ReactJS* uses this special `JSX` feature (HTML code written in JavaScript files, this is not a standard JavaScript feature).
- In addition, the could would not be optimized for production (e.g, not minified, though valid code that's highly optimized to be as short and small as possible to reduce the amount of code that has to be downloaded by the website visitor)

It's this development server which is watching your source code behind the scenes, and which is then also kind of transforming that source code behind the scenes and which is then adjusting the HTML file to contain these script elements that do then load that transformed source code.

**<span style='color: #495fcb'> Note:** that's also the reason why you also need to install NodeJS on your system in order to work on React projects.

Because NodeJS is not just used to install packages with the NPM command or to create projects with the NPX command, but instead it's also used behind the scenes by these tools that are used by that build process that's running behind the scenes.

So NodeJS is also needed and used behind the scenes to make sure that your React code gets transformed.

### Import & Export

When working in React projects, you will actually see that the extension, `.js` typically, is omitted. That's the case again, because of that build process that's running behind the scenes, which will add the extension.

If you are writing just JavaScript code without such a build process, you do need to add it on your own.

For React projects, if you explore the automatically injected script text, you don't find this type module attribute on them.

The reason for that simply is that this build process will actually take all your imports and exports and basically merge all these separate files that you have during development into one big file or a bunch of big files, which are then imported with the old school syntax in the right order.

This is done to also make this code execute in browsers that don't natively support this import export syntax, and also so that the browser doesn't have to download dozens of small JavaScript files, but instead just a couple of bigger files, which typically is more efficient.

But if you have a vanilla JavaScript app without such a build process, you do need to add this type module attribute here.

**<span style='color: #875c5c'>IMPORTANT:** If you use the default syntax, you must have only one `default export` per file.

with the default export and the respective import syntax, it is especially useful if you only have one one function, or one value in the file to export.

### Variables & Values

#### There are different types of values

- string (text)
- number (positive or negative , with decimal point (float) or without (integer))
- boolean
- Null & undefined

Variables store data, they are data containers, they have:

- variable identifier
- value (with a type)

#### Why use variables?

- reusability
- readability

if that value ever needs to change, I only need to change it in one place instead of multiple places.

**<span style='color: #495fcb'> Note:** constants (`const`) work like variables (`let`), they are data containers. But the key differences that constants must not be reassigned.

### Functions & Parameters

Functions must only have one return statement at most, functions without `return` implicitly return `undefined`

### More on the Arrow Function Syntax

to return a JS object with an arrow function:

```js
    number => ({ age: number }); // wrapping the object in extra parentheses
```

### Object & Classes

JS Objects can have:

- fields
- methods

You can access fields and methods within this object using the `this` keyword.

As an alternative to JS Objects, you can also create blueprints by using the special `class` keyword, that can then later be used to create the actual objects.

### Arrays & Array Methods

you can have arrays of arrays

- push
- findIndex
- map

**<span style='color: #495fcb'> Note:** `npx live-server` allows you to run *live-server*.

*npx* runs a command from a local or remote npm package

### Destructuring

**<span style='color: #a3842c'>Link:** [mdn webdocs/Destructuring_assignment](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Destructuring_assignment)

### Destructuring in Function Parameter Lists

The destructuring syntax explained in the previous lecture can also be used in function parameter lists.

For example, if a function accepts a parameter that will contain an object it can be destructured to "pull out" the object properties and make them available as locally scoped variables (i.e., variables only available inside the function body).

Here's an example:

```javascript
function storeOrder(order) {
    localStorage.setItem('id', order.id);
    localStorage.setItem('currency', order.currency);
}
```

Instead of accessing the order properties via the "dot notation" inside the storeOrder function body, you could use destructuring like this:

```javascript
function storeOrder({id, currency}) { // destructuring
    localStorage.setItem('id', id);
    localStorage.setItem('currency', currency);
}
```

### Spread Operator

**<span style='color: #a3842c'>Link:** [mdn webdocs/Spread_syntax](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Spread_syntax)

### Manipulating DOM

Being able to reach out to the loaded website and read and manipulate DOM Elements at runtime is of course a strength of JavaScript.

But it is also something we won't do when using React, because React will do it for us, because we write React code in that declarative way

### Functions as values

if you define a function in advance and you pass it by just using its name,so you don't add parentheses here.

You omit those parentheses because by just using the name here you're passing the function as a value to this function.

If you would add parentheses here, you would instead make sure that this function handleTimeout here gets executed immediately at the point of time when this timer is set, in this case here, and therefore it would be the return value of that function.

```javascript
//anonymous function
setTimeout(() => console.info(' Timed Out! Anonymous function'), 2000);

// equivalent to:
function handleTimeOut() {
  console.info(' Timed Out! Function as value.');
}
setTimeout(handleTimeOut, 2000);

// equivalent to:
const handleTimeOut2 = (_) => console.info(' Timed Out! Function as value.');

setTimeout(handleTimeOut2, 2000);
```

When you define such an anonymous function, you're also not executing it yet. Instead, you're also just defining it, and you're passing that defined function to set.Timeout. **You're passing a handler to that function, you're not executing it.**

**<span style='color: #875c5c'>IMPORTANT:** passing functions as values is not limited to built-in functions such as `setTimeout()`, but also to your own functions.

### Functions Defined inside of functions

you can execute the inside function within the parent function, but you can't execute it outside.

Because it's scoped inside its parent function, which means it's only available in there, just as a variable you would define inside a scope would only be available inside of the scope it was defined in and not outside of it.

### Reference vs. Primitives

Strings, numbers, Booleans are all primitives.

What's special about primitives in JavaScript is that we can't edit them.

a new primitive is created each time:

- you think you update them
- apply any native methods to such types

Arrays / Objects in JavaScript are so-called reference values, simply means that in a variable you don't store the value, but instead the address of that value in memory.

So that array is stored somewhere in memory, so in the memory of your computer, and it's the address of that place in memory that's stored in this constant.

If you apply any native methods on an Array. The array in memory changes, the address does not. That's all the reason why I can edit an array despite using declaration `const`.

With primitive values like this string, you could instead say that the string itself is stored in the variable.

#### Reference Value

## React Essentials: Components, JSX, Props, State & More

### It's all about Components

So React apps are in the end built by combining Components.

A component wraps:

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript Logic

**<span style='color: #495fcb'> Note:** And together, those languages and code pieces then define and control a part of the UI.

This allows you, the developer, to split up complex user interfaces into smaller, more manageable parts, which, at least potentially, may also be reused in different places of the UI.

#### Why Components?

- Reusable Building blocks: Create small building blocks & Compose the UI from them.  
  If needed: Reuse a building block in different parts of the UI
- Related Code lives together: HTML + CSS + JS. Since JS influences the output, storing JS  + HTML together makes sense
- separation of concerns: different components handle different data & logic. vastly simplifies the process of working on complex apps.

### Setting-up the Project

`npm outdated -l --include-dev`

### JSX & React Components

**<span style='color: #a8c62c'> index.html** loads a javascript file

```html
<script type="module" src="/src/index.jsx"></script>
```

**<span style='color: #a8c62c'> index.jsx**,

```javascript
ReactDOM.createRoot(entryPoint).render(<App />);
```

`.jsx`: JavaScript Synntax Extension, used to describe & crate HTML elements in JavaScript in a **declarative** way, but that browsers do not support.

React projects come with a build process that transforms JSX code to code that work in *browsers*. **It's important to understand that it's really just that build process that cares about this extension**.

`App.jsx` is a React component, which are JavaScript functions. **Component Functions must follow 2 rules**:

- name must start with an uppercase
- returns **renderable** content (the function must return a value that can be rendered; displayed on screen by React)

### Components & File Extensions

you'll also find React projects that don't use .jsx but instead just .js as a file extension. And in those .js files, you'll also find JSX code. Because it simply depends on the underlying build process which extension is expected when using this JSX syntax in a file.

### How React handles Component & How it builds a Component Tree

#### How Components get rendered

- `Root component`: the first component to be analyzed & rendered by React
- `Nested component`: a child component of its parent component

**<span style='color: #495fcb'> Note:** each component could then contain even more child components. ultimately you end up with a component hierarchy, which is often called a tree of components, a structure of components, which is then rendered to the screen via React.

**<span style='color: #875c5c'>IMPORTANT:** But what's important to understand about this tree of components is that your custom components are not showing up in the actual rendered DOM though. So your tree of components is just analyzed by React. And React then combines all the JSX code from all those components to generate the overall DOM.

But as a developer, you have the convenience of working with those individual building blocks instead of a single potentially huge file that contains all markup.

- Built-in elements like div, image, or header start with lowercase characters (these are **valid, officially defined HTML elements**, and rendered as **DOM nodes** by React).
- Custom components on the other hand, so components built by you or other developers must start with an uppercase character to tell React that it's not a built-in component. React traverses the component tree until it has only built-in components left

### Using & Outputting Dynamic Values

- static content
  - content that's hardcoded into JSX code
  - can't change at run time
- dynamic content
  - logic that produces the actual value is added to JSX
  - content/value is derived at runtime

**<span style='color: #875c5c'>IMPORTANT:** when using the `{}` syntax in JSX file, you can only use expressions that directly produce a value (if-statements, for-loops, function definitions and other block statements are not allowed here!)

### Setting HTML Attributes Dynamically & Loading Image Files

We optimize the import and loading of the image, thanks to the build process (this is not something you can normally do in JavaScript)

### Making Components Reusable with Props

React allows you to pass data to components via a concept called `Props`.

#### Props accept all value types

- string value
- number value
- object value
- array value

### More Prop Syntaxes

Beyond the various ways of setting and extracting props about which you learned in the previous lecture, there are even more ways of dealing with props.

#### Passing a Single Prop Object

If you got data that's already organized as a JavaScript object, you can pass that object as a single prop value instead of splitting it across multiple props.

I.e., instead of

```javascript
    <CoreConcept
      title={CORE_CONCEPTS[0].title}
      description={CORE_CONCEPTS[0].description}  
      image={CORE_CONCEPTS[0].image} />
```

or

```javascript
    <CoreConcept
      {...CORE_CONCEPTS[0]} />
```

you could also pass a single concept (or any name of your choice) prop to the CoreConcept component:

```javascript
    <CoreConcept
      concept={CORE_CONCEPTS[0]} />
```

In the CoreConcept component, you would then get that one single prop:

```javascript
    export default function CoreConcept({ concept }) {
      // Use concept.title, concept.description etc.
      // Or destructure the concept object: const { title, description, image } = concept;
    }
```

It is entirely up to you which syntax & approach you prefer.

#### Grouping Received Props Into a Single Object

You can also pass multiple props to a component and then, in the component function, group them into a single object via JavaScript's "Rest Property" syntax.

I.e., if a component is used like this:

```javascript
    <CoreConcept
      title={CORE_CONCEPTS[0].title}
      description={CORE_CONCEPTS[0].description}  
      image={CORE_CONCEPTS[0].image} />
```

You could group the received props into a single object like this:

```javascript
    export default function CoreConcept({ ...concept }) { 
      // ...concept groups multiple values into a single object
      // Use concept.title, concept.description etc.
      // Or destructure the concept object: const { title, description, image } = concept;
    }
```

If that syntax is a bit confusing - worry not! You'll also see concrete examples for this syntax (and for why you might want to use it in certain situations) throughout the course!

#### Default Prop Values

Sometimes, you'll build components that may receive an optional prop. For example, a custom Button component may receive a type prop.

So the Button component should be usable either with a type being set:

```html
    <Button type="submit" caption="My Button" />
```

Or without it:

```html
    <Button caption="My Button" />
```

To make this component work, you might want to set a default value for the type prop - in case it's not passed.

This can easily be achieved since JavaScript supports default values when using object destructuring:

```javascript
    export default function Button({ caption, type = "submit" }) { 
      // caption has no default value, type has a default value of "submit"
    }
```

### Storing Components Style Files Next to Components

in **<span style='color: #a8c62c'> Header.jsx**, when we import the .css

`import './Header.css';`

it's important to know that importing a CSS file in a Component file will not scope these styles to that Component, which simply means that if we would use a header element somewhere else on our page those styles here would be applied to that header element as well.

There's a solution to scope style to a particular component.

### Component Composition; Special "children" Prop

The content between component opening and closing tags is used as a value for the special `children` prop.

#### Children Prop

React automatically passes a special prop named `children` to every custom component

Where your Components can wrap other Components or other content is called component composition. You can pass complex HTML elements using the children prop.

### Reacting to Events

When working with React as a developer, we really don't wanna start interacting with the DOM and with the page (**imperative code**). Instead, we wanna let React do that (**declarative code**).

In React, you instead add event listeners to elements by adding a special attribute, a special prop to those elements. Those built-in elements are also just components, that are already provided and understood by React.

**<span style='color: #495fcb'> Note:** You would typically use *inner-functions*, the advantage of defining these event handler functions inside the component function is that they then have access to the components props and state.

### Passing Functions as Values to Props

**<span style='color: #a8c62c'> App.jsx**,

```javascript
const handleSelect = ()=> { console.info('click - onSelect')}

<TabButton onSelect={handleSelect}>Components</TabButton>
```

**<span style='color: #a8c62c'> TabButton.jsx**,

```javascript
export default ({ children, onSelect }) => (
  <li>
    <button onClick={onSelect}>{children}</button>
  </li>
);
```

We're passing a pointer at this `handleSelect` function. We're passing the function as a value, to the `onSelect` prop.

And in our custom component, we're then in the end forwarding that function to the `onClick` prop (**React built-in**).

### How to NOT Update the UI - A look at behind the scenes of React

**<span style='color: #875c5c'>IMPORTANT:** By default, React components execute **only once** (first time it is encountered in the JSX file). You have to *tell* React if a component should be executed again.

#### How React checks if UI Update are needed

React compares the old output (*old JSX code*) of your component function to the new output (*new JSX code*) and applies any differences to the actual website UI.

### Managing State & Using Hooks

**<span style='color: #495fcb'> Note:****<span style='color: #495fcb'> Note:** All functions starting with ***use\**** are React hooks. They're technically regular functions but they must only be called inside of React component functions or inside of other React Hooks.

#### Rules of Hooks

- only call hooks inside of component functions
- only call hooks on top level

`useState` Hook is one of the most important Hooks offered by React because that's the Hook that will allow us to manage some component specific state which is simply some data stored by React, which when changed, will trigger this component function to which this Hook belongs to re-execute, to be reevaluated by React.

`useState()` yields an array with 2 elements

- the first element in this array will be the current data snapshot for this component execution cycle (**current state value**)
- second element will always be a function; A function provided by React that can be executed to update this state, so to update this stored value. **<span style='color: #875c5c'>IMPORTANT:** calling this special function, this second element, will also tell React that this component function must be executed again.

**<span style='color: #495fcb'> Note:** this logs the previous state even if it is logged after updating the state:

```javascript
const handleSelect = (selectedButton) => {
    setSelectedTopic(selectedButton);
    console.info(selectedTopic); 
  };
```

The updated value will only be available after this app component function executed again. Only then the new value is available

### Deriving & Outputting Data Based on State

We get an error in the console when the page first loads, because we're not selecting a valid element here.

Our initial state is this *please click a button* text, And this is therefore what this program tries to find as a property name in this `examples` object.

```javascript
<div id='tab-content'>
            <h3>{EXAMPLES[selectedTopic]?.title || 'Please click a button'}</h3>
            <p>{EXAMPLES[selectedTopic]?.description}</p>
            <pre>
              <code>{EXAMPLES[selectedTopic]?.code}</code>
            </pre>
          </div>
```

### Rendering Content Conditionally

**<span style='color: #495fcb'> Note:** `null` is something you can output in JSX code, it'll simply lead to nothing being rendered here.

```javascript
{!selectedTopic ? <p>Please select a topic.</p> : null}
```

- solution 1

```javascript
{!selectedTopic ? (
  <p>Please select a topic.</p>
) : (
  <div id='tab-content'>
    <h3>{EXAMPLES[selectedTopic].title}</h3>
    <p>{EXAMPLES[selectedTopic].description}</p>
    <pre>
      <code>{EXAMPLES[selectedTopic].code}</code>
    </pre>
  </div>
)}
```

- solution 2

```javascript
 {!selectedTopic && <p>Please select a topic.</p>}
{selectedTopic && (
  <div id='tab-content'>
    <h3>{EXAMPLES[selectedTopic].title}</h3>
    <p>{EXAMPLES[selectedTopic].description}</p>
    <pre>
      <code>{EXAMPLES[selectedTopic].code}</code>
    </pre>
  </div>
)}
```

- solution 3

```javascript
  const tabContent = !selectedTopic ? (
    <p>Please select a topic.</p>
  ) : (
    <div id='tab-content'>
      <h3>{EXAMPLES[selectedTopic].title}</h3>
      <p>{EXAMPLES[selectedTopic].description}</p>
      <pre>
        <code>{EXAMPLES[selectedTopic].code}</code>
      </pre>
    </div>
  );
///...
</menu>
{tabContent}
</section>
```

### CSS Styling & Dynamic Styling

in **JSX**, the class attribute is `className`, while in HTML it is `class`. most other attributes are the same though.

### Outputting List Data Dynamically

*JSX* is capable of dealing with array of renderable data:

- array of `string`: `['Hello', 'World']`
- array of `JSX elements`: `[<p>Hello</p>, <p>World</p>]`

However JSX is not able to output an array of `JXS objects`.

But since JSX is capable of outputting an array of JSX elements, we could try to transform this array of objects to an array of JSX elements.

**<span style='color: #875c5c'>IMPORTANT:** that's another super useful feature and pattern because as it turns out, in React apps, you will often output lists of data. And you will almost always do that by using the `map` method to transform your data to JSX code.

**<span style='color: #495fcb'> Note:** Warning: *Each child in a list should have a unique "key" prop*.

```javascript
{CORE_CONCEPTS.map(conceptItem => <CoreConcept key={conceptItem.title} {...conceptItem} /> )}
```
