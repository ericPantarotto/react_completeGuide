# React - The Complete Guide 2024 (incl. Next.js, Redux)

## Getting Started

### What is React.js?

**React.js is a JavaScript library for building user intefaces**.

As you navigate around React websites, you'll see that all these transitions are super smooth, pretty much instant, and you never have this effect where you seem to load a new page.

To some extent, it therefore feels like a mobile app, because in mobile apps, getting instant feedback and having smooth transitions is pretty much the standard.

#### Using "just JavaScript" typically isn't a great option

- writing complex JavaScript code quickly becomes cumbersome
- complex JavaCcript code quickly become error-prone
- complex JavaCcript code often is hard to maintain or edit

### ReactJS vs "Vanilla JavaScript"

With React, in the example provided, in that app.js file, we just got that HTML code with  dynamic elements blended into the HTML code. It defines different states of the different HTML elements, such as an active CSS class added to a button.

- React , you define the target UI states - not the steps to go there (Declarative)
- with JavaScript, you define the steps, not the goal (Imperative)
