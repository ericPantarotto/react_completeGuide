# React - The Complete Guide 2024 (incl. Next.js, Redux)

## Getting Started

### What is React.js?

**React.js is a JavaScript library for building user intefaces**.

As you navigate around React websites, you'll see that all these transitions are super smooth, pretty much instant, and you never have this effect where you seem to load a new page.

To some extent, it therefore feels like a mobile app, because in mobile apps, getting instant feedback and having smooth transitions is pretty much the standard.

#### Using "just JavaScript" typically isn't a great option

- writing complex JavaScript code quickly becomes cumbersome
- complex JavaCcript code quickly become error-prone
- complex JavaCcript code often is hard to maintain or edit

### ReactJS vs "Vanilla JavaScript"

With React, in the example provided, in that app.js file, we just got that HTML code with  dynamic elements blended into the HTML code. It defines different states of the different HTML elements, such as an active CSS class added to a button.

- React , you define the target UI states - not the steps to go there (Declarative)
- with JavaScript, you define the steps, not the goal (Imperative)

### Creating React Projects

**<span style='color: #a3842c'>Link:** [Codesandbox_react](react.new)

---

if you prefer to use **VSCode** editor, you need to have installed *NodeJS*, as *ReactJS* uses tool such as *Vite*

**<span style='color: #a3842c'>Link:** [https://vitejs.dev/guide/](https://vitejs.dev/guide/)

`npm create vite@latest first_react_app -- --template react`

- `cd` into project
- `npm i`
- `npm run dev`

### Why do we need a special project setup?

Because when writing React code,

you'll use this special HTML in JavaScript feature, this syntax is called **JSX**.

It unfortunately doesn't work in the browser, So therefore the code you write actually must be transformed to code that does run in the browser.

![image info](./1_sc1.png)

That's the reason why you need to create React projects with extra tools like *Vite*.

because it's those tools which do transform your code to code that can be executed efficiently in the browser.

That's why you can't just create a basic HTML and script file but why you instead do need those extra tools.

## JavaScript Refresher

### Adding JavaScript to a Page & How React Projects differ

#### JavaScript can be executed in many environments

![image info](./2_sc1.png)

#### Adding JavaScript Code to a Website

- between `<script>` tags
- via `<script>` **Import**

`<script src="assets/scripts/app.js" defer type="module"></script>` unlocks 1 very important syntax: *ES6 Import* syntax.

**<span style='color: #495fcb'> Note:** when you're working on a React project, you will almost never add these script tags to your HTML file on your own, because React projects almost always use a build process which as part of that build process, injects these script tags into the HTML code for you.

### React Projects use a Build Process

`react-scripts` package provides a bunch of tools that take your code and transform it behind the scenes before it's then injected into the browser. Or to be precise, before it's then injected with help of a script tag into the HTML file.

if you inspect a web page, you can find script elements, generated and injected into this HTML file automatically behind the scenes by this built process that's running in the background.

#### Your code is transformed before it's handed off to the browser / Why React projects typically require a build process that transforms your code

**<span style='color: #495fcb'> Note:** *Vite*, *create-react-app, ... , give you such a build process (no custom setup or tweaking neede)

- raw unprocessed React Code won't execute in the browser, mostly because *ReactJS* uses this special `JSX` feature (HTML code written in JavaScript files, this is not a standard JavaScript feature).
- In addition, the could would not be optimized for production (e.g, not minified, though valid code that's highly optimized to be as short and small as possible to reduce the amount of code that has to be downloaded by the website visitor)

It's this development server which is watching your source code behind the scenes, and which is then also kind of transforming that source code behind the scenes and which is then adjusting the HTML file to contain these script elements that do then load that transformed source code.

**<span style='color: #495fcb'> Note:** that's also the reason why you also need to install NodeJS on your system in order to work on React projects.

Because NodeJS is not just used to install packages with the NPM command or to create projects with the NPX command, but instead it's also used behind the scenes by these tools that are used by that build process that's running behind the scenes.

So NodeJS is also needed and used behind the scenes to make sure that your React code gets transformed.

### Import & Export

When working in React projects, you will actually see that the extension, `.js` typically, is omitted. That's the case again, because of that build process that's running behind the scenes, which will add the extension.

If you are writing just JavaScript code without such a build process, you do need to add it on your own.

For React projects, if you explore the automatically injected script text, you don't find this type module attribute on them.

The reason for that simply is that this build process will actually take all your imports and exports and basically merge all these separate files that you have during development into one big file or a bunch of big files, which are then imported with the old school syntax in the right order.

This is done to also make this code execute in browsers that don't natively support this import export syntax, and also so that the browser doesn't have to download dozens of small JavaScript files, but instead just a couple of bigger files, which typically is more efficient.

But if you have a vanilla JavaScript app without such a build process, you do need to add this type module attribute here.

**<span style='color:   #875c5c'>IMPORTANT:** If you use the default syntax, you must have only one `default export` per file.

with the default export and the respective import syntax, it is especially useful if you only have one one function, or one value in the file to export.

### Variables & Values

#### There are different types of values

- string (text)
- number (positive or negative , with decimal point (float) or without (integer))
- boolean
- Null & undefined

Variables store data, they are data containers, they have:

- variable identifier
- value (with a type)

#### Why use variables?

- reusability
- readability

if that value ever needs to change, I only need to change it in one place instead of multiple places.

**<span style='color: #495fcb'> Note:** constants (`const`) work like variables (`let`), they are data containers. But the key differences that constants must not be reassigned.

### Functions & Parameters

Functions must only have one return statement at most, functions without `return` implicitly return `undefined`

### More on the Arrow Function Syntax

to return a JS object with an arrow function:

```js
    number => ({ age: number }); // wrapping the object in extra parentheses
```

### Object & Classes

JS Objects can have:

- fields
- methods

You can access fields and methods within this object using the `this` keyword.

As an alternative to JS Objects, you can also create blueprints by using the special `class` keyword, that can then later be used to create the actual objects.

### Arrays & Array Methods

you can have arrays of arrays

- push
- findIndex
- map

**<span style='color: #495fcb'> Note:** `npx live-server` allows you to run *live-server*.

*npx* runs a command from a local or remote npm package

### Destructuring

**<span style='color: #a3842c'>Link:** [mdn webdocs/Destructuring_assignment](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Destructuring_assignment)

### Destructuring in Function Parameter Lists

The destructuring syntax explained in the previous lecture can also be used in function parameter lists.

For example, if a function accepts a parameter that will contain an object it can be destructured to "pull out" the object properties and make them available as locally scoped variables (i.e., variables only available inside the function body).

Here's an example:

```javascript
function storeOrder(order) {
    localStorage.setItem('id', order.id);
    localStorage.setItem('currency', order.currency);
}
```

Instead of accessing the order properties via the "dot notation" inside the storeOrder function body, you could use destructuring like this:

```javascript
function storeOrder({id, currency}) { // destructuring
    localStorage.setItem('id', id);
    localStorage.setItem('currency', currency);
}
```

### Spread Operator

**<span style='color: #a3842c'>Link:** [mdn webdocs/Spread_syntax](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Spread_syntax)

### Manipulating DOM

Being able to reach out to the loaded website and read and manipulate DOM Elements at runtime is of course a strength of JavaScript.

But it is also something we won't do when using React, because React will do it for us, because we write React code in that declarative way

### Functions as values

if you define a function in advance and you pass it by just using its name,so you don't add parentheses here.

You omit those parentheses because by just using the name here you're passing the function as a value to this function.

If you would add parentheses here, you would instead make sure that this function handleTimeout here gets executed immediately at the point of time when this timer is set, in this case here, and therefore it would be the return value of that function.

```javascript
//anonymous function
setTimeout(() => console.info(' Timed Out! Anonymous function'), 2000);

// equivalent to:
function handleTimeOut() {
  console.info(' Timed Out! Function as value.');
}
setTimeout(handleTimeOut, 2000);

// equivalent to:
const handleTimeOut2 = (_) => console.info(' Timed Out! Function as value.');

setTimeout(handleTimeOut2, 2000);
```
